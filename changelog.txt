  added the hardware types
  overhauled THING, THING_TYPE, the program type definitions. added ruleset functions for thing size and value
  it's now possible to omit function call arguments. just leave the argument empty, and the default value will be used
  function arguments can now have default values
  f = FUNCTION (a=3,b=4,c=5)
  	debug(a*b*c)
  f(1,,1)  // this function call will print "4" to the debug console, because the default value is used for the omitted parameter b

  worked a bit on the deck screen
  added all the program types to the JDecker scripts. there's no functionality defined for them yet
2007-09-12
  SCROLLPANE works
  fixed a bug in AssignmentCommand regarding LOCAL variables
  started to assemble the deck_screen
2007-09-11
  added optional structure type variables which do not get copied into each instantiated structure :
    pixelwidth, pixelheight   <- if these contain functions and the width / height isn't explicitly defined, they get called
    expandable   <- got copied into each structure instance in the past
  fixed the window area turning white whenever the window size changed
  continued work on SCROLLPANE
2007-09-10
  separated the interface code from the decker scripts and made it global
  scrollbars can now be horizontal
  removed the remaining occurences of variablesSeeEachOther and variables_see_each_other
2007-09-09
  SCROLLBAR works
  getStackTrace() hardcoded function added
  function calls in all mouse events can now see all enclosing displayed structures
2007-09-04
  minor script fixes
  working on the SCROLLBAR
  fixed : a FUNCTION definition can now stand at the end of a script, even if it has no function body and no argument list
2007-09-03
  added the & operator
  changed the @ behaviour to execute implicitly again, unless the & operator is used
  removed some clutter that had accumulated in the game scripts while I was trying out different implementations of the @ operator
2007-09-02
  fixed the @ operator. it now works at least for colors
  if A contains an @ operator, then B = A will put the @ operator in B too. the operator won't be evaluated
  colors work again. looks like a few other things are botched now
2007-08-03
  FunctionCall.java now produces a helpful error message if it gets called for a value that is not a function
  fixed a number of places where script function calls didn't use the new function names
  moved the static functions from FunctionCall.java to their own class StaticScriptFunctions.java
2007-05-09
  DRAWING_BOUNDARY and a clipping mechanism added
2007-05-08
  v_align and h_align added for easier placement of screen elements
  TABLE type added. so far it displays a table. dragging rows doesn't work yet
2007-05-07
  fps setting and mechanism added
2007-05-04
  you can set REAL_EQUAL_RANGE to some value between 0.0 and 1.0 to set the maximum difference between two real numbers which are treated as equal. If no value is set or it is not a real number, 0.000000001 is used instead
  the parser now recognizes real numbers. it rejects numbers like .5 and 5. there has to be at least one digit before and after the . like in 5.5
  expressions work with real numbers
2007-05-01
  variables can now store real numbers

  image names are no longer case sensitive
  all images are loaded at program start

  home button added
  BORDER_BUTTON structure type added
  all standard buttons turned into BORDER_BUTTONs and the button images changed accordingly
  character screen finished
2007-04-25
  character screen almost complete
  a = FUNCTION b operator replaced with @b operator
  integers in font descriptions are now interpreted as font sizes (in points), so "Arial;13" now describes the same font as "Arial;13pt"
  date_day_of_month() and date_days_in_month() hardcoded functions added
2007-04-24
  bug fixed : a = LINE would save the structure type LINE in a instead of a new LINE, if the type name wasn't followed by a definition body
  SCREEN_BACKGROUND structure type added
  finished replacing colors and fonts with functions that fetch the current values for them, for easy modding
  background images of the new character screen and the home screen replaced with drawn backgrounds
