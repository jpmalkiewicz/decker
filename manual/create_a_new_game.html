            JDecker isn't just the game Decker, it's a game engine, and you can make your own games with it. This guide will take you through the steps, using Minesweeper as an example. At the end of each big section you'll find a link to a .zip file that contains the state the example game has reached, to help you when you are stuck. Just extract it to the jdecker folder
            <p><font color=red>The sections below with olive background are script code. To make them display well in the browser, they use three spaces for block indentation. Usually a tab (as in tabulator key) is used instead, but both methods work. You can just copy/paste the code sections into a script, save it, and start the engine, to see what the code does</font>
            <p><font color=yellow>Every game has its own folder in the rulesets folder.</font> Go there and create a folder called <font color=#00ff00>minesweeper</font>. In that folder, create a second folder called <font color=#00ff00>artwork</font>. All the scripts that make our game work will be in the minesweeper folder and all the artwork (images, sounds) will be in the artwork folder
            <p>You can launch JDecker with some game immediately running with the command line options. In the jdecker folder, make a batch file with the following line
            <p><font color=#00ff00>java -classpath . decker.Decker initial_ruleset=minesweeper</font>
            <p>If you're using Windows, do this by making a text file called <font color=#00ff00>minesweeper.bat</font> and putting that line in the file.
            <p>Most games need some images. Fetch the <a href="create_a_new_game_data/minesweeper_0_artwork.zip">minesweeper_0_artwork.zip</a> and unzip it to the rulesets/battleships/artwork folder. Now we're all set to create the scripts for the game

            You have a grid square tiles. At the beginning of the game each tile is covered. there may or may not be a bomb in it (never more than one). If there is no bomb but one or more adjacent tiles (diagonal counts) with bombs in them, the number of adjacent bombs is displayed on the tile when it is uncovered. The player uncovers tiles by left-clicking them. If the player uncovers a bomb the game is over. Whenever a tile with no bombs adjacent gets uncovered, all adjacent tiles get uncovered (they may also have no bombs adjacent, then the process is repeated for them). When all empty cells are uncovered, the game is won and the player's score is the time it took (lower is better)

            Each game written with the JDecker engine needs to define at least one screen. The "screen" is actually the area inside the game window (not including the title bar and border), but if we wanted to we could make it display fullscreen instead, so it gets the honor of getting called a "screen". Decker for example has a new character screen, a home menu screen, a character screen, a contracts screen, and so on
            <p>Our game only needs one screen. Let's call it game_screen and define it in a script file called <font color=#00ff00>game_screen.txt</font>. Scripts are simple text files and use the .txt extension, without the .txt the engine won't find them. The whole game could be defined in a single script, but defining it in several script files with specific topics really helps find things again. When there are multiple scripts, they get executed in alphabetical order, with _ coming before A coming before 3 coming before a. This is important because <font color=yellow>you can only use things after they have been defined</font>. An example for this will come up soon : you can only set the initial screen for a ruleset (to the engine, our game is just a ruleset plus some artwork) after that screen has been defined
            <p>So let's define our game_screen. To keep things simple, we'll use a background image that already has the map grid. It also has some frills. Good looking games attract more players and give them better entertainment. The background image has a size of <font color=red>???x???</font> pixels, same as the screen we're defining.
            <p><font color=red>no background image yet</font>
            <p><table><tr><td><pre>
RULESET.game_screen = COMPONENT

RULESET.initial_screen = game_screen</pre></td></tr></table>
            <p>That's enough to create a screen with a background image, make it display immediately when the JDecker engine is started with our special command line (see above), and it even reacts to mouse clicks. You probably didn't understand most of what just happened there, so let's get some basics out of the way and then look at that script again afterwards
			<p>Some lines start further right than others. This is important. Like most programming languages, the JDecker scripting language has blocks. A block is a group of lines which all start on the same column. Between them may be lines which start even further right, those do not end the block. Each block ends when a line that stands further left is encountered.
			Blocks are lines of script code which belong together, and there is always a line that stands further left right before the block starts. The block is said to belong to the command on that line, be inside it, be enclosed in it, belong to it. The only exception to this rule is the whole script within a .txt file. It is a block too, but has no enclosing line. Here are a few examples. Each block has its own color, all lines which belong to the same block have the same color

			<p>The next concept you need to understand is the variable. Variables in programming languages are just like in maths. For example, x and y may be coordinates and have values. You can assign values to them, and use their values somewhere else. The JDecker scripting language lets you store ANYTHING in a variable. A text, a whole screen, even a whole game, a number, a structure, a function, and so on. In the code below, all variables are marked green. As you can see, _ is a normal letter. You can use numbers in variables too, but better not use them as the first letter. So t73, b_forward, c12 would all three be valid variable names. If a word doesn't work as a variable name, JDecker will tell you when you try to start a game

			<p>Next up is the function concept. Functions work pretty much like in maths. They usually return a value and usually have parameters. You define a new function by writing <font color=white><nobr>sum = FUNCTION (var_a, var_b)</nobr></font> or something similar, followed by a block that defines the function. The FUNCTION command tells the scripting language that you are now going to define a function. You have to store your function in a variable so you can later use it. In maths you would write f(x) to call a function, and it looks exactly the same in the scripting language. If you want a function to return a value, you have to set the return_value variable within the function body. Here are a few examples
            <p><table><tr><td><pre><font color=#00aa00>// this line is a comment. the JDecker engine ignores the double slashes // and everything behind them

// let's define two functions, one adds its two parameters and returns the result ...</font>
RULESET.add = FUNCTION (a, b)
   return_value = a+b
   <font color=#00aa00>// debug is one of the functions provided by the scripting language
   // it prints its first parameter to the Java console</font>
   debug(a+" + "+b+" = "+return_value)

<font color=#00aa00>// ... the other does the same but multiplies them</font>
RULESET.multiply = FUNCTION (a, b)
   return_value = a * b
   debug(a+" * "+b+" = "+return_value)

<font color=#00aa00>// add and multiply are normal variables, but they now contain functions. Let's call those functions</font>
add(5,10)
multiply(2,3)
<font color=#00aa00>// you can use pretty much anything as a function parameter, the return value of another function for example</font>
multiply(2,add(1,1))
debug( "2*(1+1) = " + multiply(2,add(1,1)) )
<font color=#00aa00>// and of course we can store the return value of a function in a variable for later use, too</font>
LOCAL.d = add(2, 3)
LOCAL.g = multiply(3,3)
debug("d = "+d+"  , g = "+g)
d = add(d,g)
debug("d = "+d+"  , g = "+g)</pre></td></tr></table>
			<p>Structures are groups of variables. Some contain a fixed set of variables, others let you add new variables to them, depending on their type. Structure types are customarily written all uppercase, to tell tem apart from variables. You can define your own structure types. rulesets/_c_interface_structure_types.txt contains all the default structure types used in JDecker except for the types RULESET, GLOBAL and LOCAL. You create a new structure by assigning its type to a variable, followed by an optional block that assigns initial values to the variables of the new structure. In our screen definition we define two structures, a COMPONENT and an IMAGE structure. The yellow part is the IMAGE definition, the green and yellow sections together are the definition of the COMPONENT structure
			<p>The . operator lets you access the member variables of a structure. There's three ways to do this. Usually you have some variable foo of  type WHATEVER that contains a variable bar, and you access bar by writing foo.bar. The second option is to use the name of a structure type instead of a variable that contains a structure, for example WHATEVER.bar. This only works if there is currently a structure of type WHATEVER on the stack. The stack is the thing that holds all data while you play a game. Use the command debug(getStack(),,1) to print the current stack to the Java console. There's always a structure of type ENGINE, RULESET, GLOBAL, and LOCAL on the stack, in that order. All of these structure types are expandable, meaning you can add new variables to structures of those types. So RULESET.game_screen = ... adds a variable called game_screen to the current RULESET structure on the stack, and gives it some value. Structures which are currently being created are also on the stack. The final way to access a variable from a structure is to just write its name. In that case the engine goes through the list of structures on the stack (starting from the end of the list, where the last added structures are) and fetches the first variable of that name it finds. If it doesn't find one it adds one to the bottom most structure on the stack that is currently being created and is expandable. If there's no such structure it adds it to the bottom most expandable structure. That's usually the structure of type LOCAL

			<p>ARRAY is a special structure type. Instead of holding variables, it has a list of values and you can reach them through their index. The entries in an array always have the indices 0, 1, 2, 3, ... Actually, there's exactly one normal variable in each array, but you cannot assign a value to it. It's called size and does exactly what its name says. It holds the size of the array. Here's an example of an array definition and some code to show you how its entries and size can be used

         Let's make our game look cool. As soon as the player releases the left mouse button above a ship, it is picked up and moved along with the mouse. When the player releases the left mouse button the next time the ship is dropped back into the harbour, if it happened outside the player's grid. Each press of the any other mouse button turns the picked up ship by 90 degrees (and each key press, for all those poor people who can't afford a second mouse button)
         While the picked up ship is completely above the map grid it will "snap" into the grid coordinates. Blocked map cells will be marked red. If the ship can be placed where it is displayed, the cells beneath it will be marked green. Whenever all ships are placed, a "Done" button will appear
         <p>From now on omitted script sections will be replaced with a triple dot <font color=#ffff00>...</font>
         <p>We could turn the seven ship images into buttons now, but we will get a lot of other mouse events, so to keep things simple we'll use a different approach. All mouse events on the whole screen will be handled in one place. Let's start with the release mouse button event. It is handled by the FUNCTION stored in on_mouse_up, if there is one. Any structure that is displayed may have these functions which receive user input. Key presses are sent to all displayed structures which have an on_key_pressed function. Likewise with the on_mouse_up function, but only structures where the mouse is inside receive the event

         <p>We have a function but it doesn't do anything yet. First we have to determine where the mouse was when the mouse button was released. We could type in the coordinates of the ship images again and compare the mouse coordinates with them. But then we would have entered each ship coordinate twice, and it will appear at least two more times on the screen where the game is actually played. So instead we will define a new structure type for our ships, called SHIP, and store all the relevant data for each ship in it

For that we use the for loop again, and we'll go through our list of images and check or each whether it was clicked. Each mouse button has an id, first button's id is 1, second mouse button's id is 2 and so on

      <font color=#00aa00>// the if clause is another feature most programming languages have. If the expression
      // after the "if" has the logical value "true", the block of commands inside the if clause gets executed.

            <p>Now we can test whether our program reacts correctly when we release the left mouse button. If everything went well, the function gets called whenever any mouse button is pressed, and if it was the first mouse button, a short text is printed in the Java console, telling us which ship has been selected

			The structures in the "component" array are displayed first to last. Since we want our picked up ship to always be on top, we'll add an extra IMAGE for it at the end of the array. Whenever we pick up a ship, we will make that extra IMAGE display the picked up ship, centered on the mouse tip, and make the old image of the ship invisible.

			Well, it turns out that a good looking Battleships is a too complicated example for a tutorial. The next step adds another 150 lines of code and all it does is let the player put ships on the map and remove them. I have marked the beginning of each section in the code that is new or has changed with a // *** if anybody is interested. Often it's just a line or a few lines, but the addition to the on_mouse_up function is about 120 lines
