Engine:
DisplayedComponent.eventValueChanged() creates new interface objects without removing the old ones from the data objects they listen to
hardcode addTableRow, deleteTableRow, selectTableRow   => on_selection_changed
does the real numbers parser work again? (in decker.model.ScriptReader)
error message when image missing
error message on faulty font description
? popup border doesn't display ?
AssignmentCommand.fetchStructureMember() is used even if the member variable definitely exists. that's pointless
COMPONENT.draw()  could change the displayed_screen. this would not stop the drawing of the current screen


Engine wishlist:
mousewheel support
draggable popups
color tags within text ( #error, #success )
remove KEEP_STACK if it isn't used anywhere
StaticScriptFunctions.execute_delete() should call a function that tells the listeners that the variable has been deleted, not that it has been changed
