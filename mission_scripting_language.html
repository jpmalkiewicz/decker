<br><h2>Variables</h2><p>In a mission script you mainly set, use
            and change variables to describe the mission and how it affects the game world.
            <p>Variable names are case sensitive. foo_name and Foo_Name are
            regarded as different variables.
            <p>There are four groups of variables : Predefined player variables
            describe the person the player controls. Predefined mission variables
            describe the mission and cease to exist once
            the mission is over. Custom mission variables are created by a mission
            script ( they cease to exist once that mission is over ).
            Custom player variables are defined by a mission script ( they exist
            as long as the player for which they have been defined does ).
            <p>Variables may be assigned predefined values,
            integer values, string values, boolean values or structures.
            Some of the predefined values are UNDEFINED , INCOMPLETE
            , COMPLETED , FAILED , MEGACORP , ELECTRONICS
            , BANK , LAB , MEDICAL , MANUFACTURING , SCHOOL , OIL , GREEN , YELLOW , RED , SHUT_DOWN. true and false
            are the boolean values, any whole number in the range from -2147483648 to
            2147483647 is an integer value, anything that starts and
            ends with a " is a string
            value.
            <p>Each variable has a value. A variable that has not been assigned
            a value has the value UNDEFINED unless it has some other value by default.
            <p>When assembling strings, variables containing predefined values
            show up as "X" within the assembled string, where X is the name of
            the predefined value ( the expression &nbsp; "a "+FAILED+" mission" &nbsp; would
            create the string "a FAILED mission" ).
            <p>The following examples assign the boolean value false, the integer value 5 and the string
            value "something" to the custom mission variables a, b and
            c, respectively.
            <p>

			<p>Custom variables are created when they are first used during the execution of a mission
            script. Custom player variables have the prefix player. to their name (
            this makes them member variables of the player structure ). Custom mission variables have
            a normal name. Any name may be used for a custom variable, unless it has a predefined meaning or
            is used for a predefined variable. Variable names may only consist of latin
            characters ( a to z and A to Z ), digits and the character _ . Every variable
            name must contain at least one non-digit character. Below are examples of valid and invalid custom variable names.

<br><h2>Structures</h2><p>A structure is basically a collection of variables. Each
            structure has a type, and the member variables of a structure are specific for its type.
            A new structure is created when its type name occurs on the right side of the = command in the script.
            The type name must be followed by a block. Inside that block variables of the structure may be
            assigned values. Valid types are SYSTEM , FILE , POPUP
            , NO_RED_ALARM , TIME_RESTRICTION , CRASH_SYSTEM
            , CREATE_BACKDOOR , DOWNLOAD_FILE , EDIT_FILE , DELETE_FILE and MANIPULATE_IO.<p>If you want to access a
            member variable of a structure, you give the name of the variable that
            holds the structure, followed by a dot and the name of the member
            variable within the structure.<p>Below is an example of how an EDIT_FILE and a FILE structure is

            a file and add the goal to edit that file to the mission. It will

            which is evaluated every time something changes in the

            is closed, the POPUP member variable choice is assigned the
